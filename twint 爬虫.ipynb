FYI, Telos was also independently validated by EOS BPs not part of Telos. “We validated two different CSV files: one generated by ourselves from the original EOS mainnet launch snapshot CSV and one supplied by the Telos Foundation.”\n",

They will support EOS and WORBLI in more ways (like voting and using the chain) because they have token and are by default a stakeholder.
